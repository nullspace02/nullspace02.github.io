    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>This is a concise guide on how to learn how to read in Japanese. For something more comprehensive see <a href="https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/" class="green">[Kuri's guide]</a> and/or <a href="https://learnjapanese.moe/guide" class="purple">[Shoui's guide]</a>.</p>
    <p>Last updated 2025-06-18.</p>

    <h1 id="foundation">Foundation</h1>
    <h2 id="kana">Kana</h2>
    <p>Hiragana and Katakana are the 2 basic "alphabets" used in Japanese. You can learn them <a href="https://vedxyz.github.io/kana/" class="red">[here]</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="kanji">Kanji</h2>
    <p>Kanji is another writing system used in Japanese. ~3000 characters are regularly used, and each kanji represents a meaning. However, the pronunciation ("reading") of a kanji changes depending on the word it is used in. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>一 (いち) "one"</li>
        <li>一つ (ひとつ) "one thing"</li>
        <li>日 (ひ) "day" or "sun"</li>
        <li>一日 (いちにち) "one day"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unlike kana, it doesn't make sense to learn kanji or their readings in isolation. Learn words.</p>
    
    <h2 id="vocab">Basic Vocabulary</h2>
    <p>Memorise ~1000 common words. I recommend you do this with <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" class="blue">[Anki]</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/releases" class="red">[Kaishi 1.5k]</a> deck. You can learn how to use Anki with the <a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/studying.html" class="blue">[Anki Manual]</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="grammar">Basic Grammar</h2>
    <p>Read through the <a href="https://yoku.bi/Introduction.html" class="blue">[Yokubi Grammar Guide]</a>.</p>

    
    <h1 id="core">Core</h1>
    <h2 id="yomitan">Yomitan Setup</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://yomitan.wiki/getting-started/" class="purple">[Yomitan]</a> browser extension will allow you to look up unknown words as you hover over them. The most important dictionaries you should install on it are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/stephenmk/Jitendex/releases/latest" class="green">[Jitendex]</a> for vocabulary</li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DRFhsmAr6wVs1SG9MRNvgkEvs6Yrpgig/view?usp=drive_link" class="red">[Dictionary of Japanese Grammar]</a> for grammar</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Kuuuube/yomitan-dictionaries/raw/main/dictionaries/JPDB_v2.2_Frequency_Kana_2024-10-13.zip" class="red">[JPDB Frequency v2.2]</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To make sure results are sorted properly, go to Yomitan settings > Dictionaries and set "Frequency sorting dictionary" to JPDBv2.</p>

    <h2 id="howtoread">How to Read</h2>
    <p id="mindset">Mindset:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first thing you read will be <i>extremely</i> difficult, no matter what it is or how many words you've memorised. Vocabulary size and reading ability are not the same thing, so don't fall into the common trap of putting off reading by memorising more words instead. The only way to get better at reading is to read, and it will be <i>much</i> easier after you finish your first book.</li>
        <li>DO NOT use machine translation (Google Translate, DeepL, ChatGPT etc), even if you are stuck! It will most likely be wrong, unnatural or misleading.</li>
        <li>Enjoyment always takes priority over efficiency. If you have a choice between something that is easy but boring or something that is interesting but hard, choose the hard one.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5fESa09D3o" class="orange">[Why you can't understand sentences (even though you know all the words)]</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p id="process">The reading process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Look up every unknown word/grammar in the sentence with Yomitan. Try to memorise their meanings and readings.</li>
        <li>Try to understand what the sentence as a whole means. If you're struggling, try to identify the main structure of the sentence as explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxYZH5P9hyY&t=96s" class="red">[this video]</a>. If you still can't figure it out after a little while, just move on.</li>
        <li>Move on to the next sentence and repeat.</li>
    </ul>

    <p id="memory">How to remember words:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read more. After enough lookups, you will eventually remember the word.</li>
        <li>If the word contains an unknown kanji, break it down into its components and see if you can relate their meaning to the main kanji with logic, association or a mnemonic.</li>
    </ul>

    <p id="readmore">How to spend more time reading:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make reading into a small habit (e.g. 10 minutes every morning) then slowly increase it over time.</li>
        <li>Use a <a href="https://pomofocus.io/" class="orange">[pomodoro timer]</a> to maintain focus. If you want, you can change the default time ratio of 25/5 to something else like 45/15.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 id="read">Read!</h2>
    <p>Read whatever you like!</p> 
    <p>For visual novels, you can use <a href="https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor/" class="red">[Textractor]</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/0xDC00/agent" class="purple">[Agent]</a>) and a clipboard inserter {<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lap-clipboard-inserter/" class="orange">[Firefox]</a>, <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clipboard-inserter/deahejllghicakhplliloeheabddjajm" class="green">[Chrome]</a>} to extract text to a <a href="https://kuuuube.github.io/texthooker/index.html">texthooking page</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/rampaa/JL" class="yellow">[JL]</a>).</p>
    <p>You can read light novels (as EPUB or HTMLZ files) with <a href="https://reader.ttsu.app" class="blue">[ッツ Reader]</a>.</p>
    <p>You can read manga (with Yomitan-able HTML text) at the <a href="https://catalog.mokuro.moe/" class="red">[Mokuro Catalog]</a>. For manga not in the catalog, you can use <a href="https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro" class="red">[mokuro]</a> or <a href="https://github.com/matt-m-o/YomiNinja" class="orange">[YomiNinja]</a>.</p>
    <p>If you're unsure on what to read, I'd suggest <a href="https://tsukiweb.holofield.fr/title" class="blue">[月姫 (Tsukihime)]</a> as an easy visual novel that you can read for free in your browser. You can change the language to Japanese via Config > Advanced > Language > 日本語.</p>
    <p>For more recommendations, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w42HEKEu2AzZg9K7PI0ma9ICmr2qYEKQ9IF4XxFSnQU/edit?gid=1999205540#gid=1999205540" class="green">[Kuri's recommendation sheet]</a>. Anything rated Medium or below is suitable for your first read.</p>


    <h1 id="extra">Extra</h1>
    <h2 id="extrayomitan">Further Yomitan Setup</h2>
    <p>There are many monolingual (JP-JP) dictionaries available for Yomitan. These provide more accurate definitions and larger coverage of unknown words. I use the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/MarvNC/yomitan-dictionaries?tab=readme-ov-file#%E6%BC%A2%E6%A4%9C%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97%E8%BE%9E%E5%85%B8%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E7%89%88-kanken-kanji-jiten-2nd-edition" class="red">[漢検漢字辞典　第二版]</a> for concise vocab definitions and kanji information</li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/169tv6bKqqGuv8Y5Wj9f8SpP3IGxYZUKD/view?usp=drive_link" class="blue">[三省堂]</a> for easy definitions</li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mmr7IIy9CWv9YlCezrOE7JK-7PBV_CyI/view?usp=drive_link" class="blue">[デジタル大辞泉]</a> for much larger coverage</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/MarvNC/yomichan-dictionaries/raw/master/dl/%5BMonolingual%5D%20PixivLight.zip" class="pink">[Pixiv Light]</a> for cultural references</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/kaanium/VNDB-Names-for-Yomitan/releases" class="purple">[VNDB Names]</a> for visual novel character names</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/yomidevs/jmdict-yomitan/releases" class="green">[JMnedict]</a> for general names</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To be able to look up unknown words within monolingual definitions, go to Yomitan settings > Popup Behavior and enable "Allow scanning popup content".</p>
    <p>You can find more dictionaries in <a href="https://github.com/MarvNC/yomitan-dictionaries" class="yellow">[Marv's collection]</a>.</p>


    <h2 id="extragrammar">Further Grammar Study</h2>
    <p>You will eventually acquire all the grammar knowledge you'll ever need just by reading more. However, if you'd like to do some dedicated study, you can use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://gohoneko.neocities.org/grammar/masterreference" class="yellow">[Japanese Grammar Master Reference]</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://nihongokyoshi-net.com/jlpt-grammars/" class="red">[Nihongokyoshi]</a> (monolingual)</li>
    </ul>
